# QA-automation

Project to demonstrate my coding ability in Python, specifically using REST APIs to test a WooCommerce site. 

This suite of test cases runs against an example site,  It uses WooCommerce REST API endpoints to retrieve data about the test site, and analyzes JSON payloads returned by these endpoints.

## Prerequisites

To run this suite, I set up a test Wordpress site.
The test data I'm using is a default test data set.
The main tool I'm using to run the suite is Pytest 7.2.1, and the version of Python I'm working with is 3.11. 

## Skills and tech I'm demonstrating here

- Use of the Python Requests library to do REST API calls and get JSON back
- Testing against a site running as a Docker container
- Positive test cases
